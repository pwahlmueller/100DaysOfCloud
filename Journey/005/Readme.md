# The New Subscription (and more)

## Introduction

We had to add a new subscription to a tenent - not so easy, because we wanted to have an EA enrollment linked to that subscription.

## The New Subscription

So the first thing is, that we have several enrollments (see https://ea.azure.com) and several tenents on https://portal.azure.com.

What do you have to do?

1. [Sign in to the EA Portal](https://eq.azure.com)
2. Add a New Account, which is able to create a subscription in the tenent of your choice on [Azure](portal.azure.com) or use an existing one.
3. Click add Subscription on the [EA Portal](https://eq.azure.com)
4. Make sure you landed in the right Azure subscription.
5. Select offen "Microsoft Azure Enterprise"
6. Check the boxes - and register.
7. Done

## Cost Tool

Seems to be a nice [cost tool](https://github.com/Azure/SAP-on-Azure-Scripts-and-Utilities/tree/master/Costmanagement-Dashboard) - but did not have a glance yet.

## Tenants

Nice Made it to get all ad-users of multiple tenants. Think I'll do a blog post about that soon.
