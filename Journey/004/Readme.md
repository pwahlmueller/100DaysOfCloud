# More Azure

## Introduction

To be honest, there where some Azure stuff in the last days, but did not wrote anything down. And yes, it's a little bit rainy today.

## Try yourself

### Step 1 â€” Bicep - an ARM DSL

Ignite Azure recording from Mark Russinovich  link [Link](https://myignite.microsoft.com/sessions/40aca11c-8e28-4914-a6d8-b3a7efb4eee1)

Got a hint - should do something for my Bicep skills.

* [Bicep - an ARM DSL](https://aka.ms/bicep)
* [Set up Bicep](https://github.com/Azure/bicep/blob/master/docs/installing.md)
* [Bicep Template](https://github.com/Azure/bicep/blob/master/docs/tutorial/01-simple-template.md)
* [Bicep Playground](https://bicepdemo.z22.web.core.windows.net/)

But be aware, it's new - so no IntelliSense and minimal resource schema validation.

### Step 2 - gRPC

* [REST vs gRPC](https://code.tutsplus.com/tutorials/rest-vs-grpc-battle-of-the-apis--cms-30711)
